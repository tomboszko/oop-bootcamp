This exercise consists of multiple use cases. It's recommended to have one repo, and have multiple folders in there to contain everything. 

ðŸ’¡ There's not one perfect solution, but 100 different ones with pro's and con's. Discussing often can be a good learning moment.

# My experience

It's quite fun to work in oriented object programming, I find it "normal way of working".

I had some struggles with the child classes (extends) because I didn't knew that we must "recall" the constructor of the parent class **and then** add child class.


# Note

To add a touch of creativity,when the result is stylized, I made it via an AI, I assume it completly as the main purpose of those exercices is to handle mainly backend side. :trollface:
